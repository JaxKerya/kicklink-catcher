KickLink Catcher does not collect, store, transmit, or sell any personal data.

All captured links and user settings are stored locally in the user's browser using chrome.storage.local.

The extension does not send data to external servers and does not use analytics, tracking scripts, or third-party data sharing.

KickLink Catcher only runs on https://dashboard.kick.com
and does not access browsing activity outside this domain.
